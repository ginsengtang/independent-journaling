# Independent Journaling Application

## Requirements:

- self-hosted, choose your own cloud provider
- redundant, application backs data up somewhere
- multimedia, should be able to upload video or mp3 or markup or images
- searchable, should be able to search through journal entries
- private public distinction, you have the authority to make posts public or private
- mobile app, logs into your server and posts

## Nice to haves:

- metadata
- personal visualizations
- reactions

## Reasoning:

- centralized, social media giants have the authority to censor your speech and cut off their services from you
- centralized cloud providers like AWS, Linode have the authority to cut off their services from you
- if you have years of data on one platform, your data could be withheld from you, with no recourse

- Open Source, Free
- No Central Host
